# qe-interfaces

This repo contains python tools that are useful in understanding interfaces in heterostructures consisting of two or more materials within a density-functional theory framework. These tools are meant to be used in conjunction with Quantum Espresso input and output files. I developed them during my MSc when I was studying Ca2N-MoS2 and Au-Ca2N-MoS2 heterostrucures, but they can be modified for use with other supercells. 

Check out the resulting paper: [Improved Charge Transfer and Barrier Lowering across a Auâ€“MoS2 Interface through Insertion of a Layered Ca2N Electride](https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.dal.ca/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c02142). It will come in handy in explaining what these tools are useful for.
